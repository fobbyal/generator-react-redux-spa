#Poject is still in Alpha

## What is this for?
This is a geneartor used to create scalable react-redux based apps. The dir structure is based on the [Three Rules For Structuring (Redux) Applications]( https://jaysoo.ca/2016/02/28/organizing-redux-application/) written by Jack Hsu. I've been using this for a few projects and have enjoyed the convention and decided to try to adopt this at work. However, the amount of the boilerplate required gave me second thoughs. And then.... the idea of this project was born.

## Who is this for
Anyone who wants setup a scalable react-redux application. 

## What this is not
This was created to lighten workload on developers at my work as we are trying out the directory structure. It is heavily opiniated. It is not meant to support every possible way of creating a react app.  This is by no means a standard for react apps. There are certainly better ways to do this.

## Problems with this generator
1. Front end only. I work in a environment that does not have javascript as a backend.
2. Boat load of dependencies you may or may not need. (I trust that able developers can remove them failry quickly)
3. favors yarn instead of npm
4. I put my own .eslint config in here


## Noted features 
1. React Hot Loader
2. React Storybook
3. Redux dev tools comaptible

## More docs needed
